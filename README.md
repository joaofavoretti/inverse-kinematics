# Inverse Kinematics

**Version 1.0.0**

This is just an experiment to learn about inverse kinematics. I just created a repository to host the page on Github.

The program uses the p5.js library to create a visual representation of some properties from Inverse Kinematics.

This is the "second part" from the forward kinematics repository.
